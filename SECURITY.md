## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT CREATE A PUBLIC ISSUE FOR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

Send an encrypted email to: **security@your-domain.com** (replace with your actual contact)
- Use PGP Key: [Your PGP Key Fingerprint]
- Subject: `SECURITY: Vulnerability in SPECTRE-GIT`

### 2. **Include the Following Information**
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, code execution, data leak)
- Full paths and line numbers of affected code
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### 3. **Response Time**
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours

## Security Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Always use Tor** for operational security
2. **Encrypt all output files** immediately after generation
3. **Use disposable environments** for scanning operations
4. **Verify targets are authorized** before scanning
5. **Regularly rotate operational identities**

### For Developers:
```bash
# Security development practices
- Use `bandit` for security scanning: `bandit -r .`
- Regular dependency audits: `safety check`
- Code reviews for all security-sensitive changes
